Made in 2 days.. Except the 3d engine.. that took way longer

Just fixed my first ever method to apply more than 16 colors on the console
without using GDI+.

The idea was to use the full block characters with background and
foreground color to make it look like a new color.

Using this method i was able to create 384 different combinations.
And thats a lot more than 16 :D
